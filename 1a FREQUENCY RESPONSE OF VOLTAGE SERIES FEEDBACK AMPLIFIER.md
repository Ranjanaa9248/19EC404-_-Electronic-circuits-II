## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | = f1= 0.25KHz | = f1"= 0.24KHz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = f2=1.4MHz | = f2"= 2.7MHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 1.39MHz \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 2.6MHz \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | ( A{v(mid)} = 21 ) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 17.04 ) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | Go = 4.84 | Go"= 12.08  |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
